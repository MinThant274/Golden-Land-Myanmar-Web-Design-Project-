				Kachin, more precisely known as Jingpho Wunpong (Jingpho: Jinghpaw Wunpawng the Confederation of Jingpo) or simply Wunpong (the Confederation), are a confederation of ethnic groups who inhabit the Kachin Hills in northern Myanmar's Kachin State and neighbouring Yunnan Province, China, and Arunachal Pradesh, Assam in Northeastern India. 
				About one million Kachin peoples live in the region. The term Kachin people is often used interchangeably with the main subset, called the Jingpo people in China.
				 Kachin State is the northernmost state of Myanmar. 
				 It is bordered by China to the north and east (Tibet and Yunnan, specifically and respectively); Shan State to the south; and Sagaing Region and India to the west.
		  </p>
		  <p>The Jingpho language common to many of the Kachin has a variety of dialects and is written with a Latin-based script created in the late nineteenth century. A Burmese script version was subsequently developed. The Singhpo dialect is spoken in Northeast India and Jingpho in Southwest China.
		  </p>
		  <p>Kachin is an ethnicity that comprises various linguistic groups with overlapping territories and integrated social structures. Contemporary usage of Kachin relates to a grouping of six ethnicities: Rawang, the Lisu, the Jingpo, the Zaiwa, the Lashi/Lachik and the Lawngwaw/Maru. Some definitions distinguish Kachin and Shan (Tai) peoples though some Kachin people have demonstrated the over-simplicity of the concept of lineage-based ethnic identity by culturally "becoming Shans".

				The Karenni, also known as the Kayahli, the Kayah, or the Kayahli (meaning "red human"), are a Sino-Tibetan ethnic group native to the Kayah State of Myanmar (Burma).
		  </p>
		  <p>
				According to a 1983 census, the Karenni consist of the following groups: Kayah, Geko (Kayan Ka Khaung, Gekho, Gaykho), Geba (Kayan Gebar, Gaybar), Padaung (Kayan Lahwi), Bre, Manu-Manau (Manumanao), Yintale, Yinbaw, Bwe and Pao. Several of the groups (Geko, Geba, Padaung, Yinbaw) belong to Kayan, a subgroup of Karenni. The groups Bre and Manu-Manau belong to the Kayaw subgroup.

				The Karen, Kayin, Kariang or Yang people are an ethnolinguistic group of Sino-Tibetan language-speaking ethnic groups. 
				The group as a whole is heterogeneous and disparate as many Karen ethnic groups do not associate or identify with each other culturally or linguistically. 
				These Karen groups reside primarily in Kayin State, southern and southeastern Myanmar. 
				The Karen make up approximately 7% of the total Burmese population with approximately five million people. 
				Many Karen have migrated to Thailand, having settled mostly on the Thailandâ€“Myanmar border. 
				A few Karen have settled in Andaman and Nicobar islands, India and other South-East Asian and East Asian countries.
