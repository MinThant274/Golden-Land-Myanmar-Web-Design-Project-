		  The Bamar (Burmese also historically the Burmese and Burmans) are a Sino-Tibetan ethnic group and nation native to Myanmar (Burma) where they are the dominant group. 
		  The Bamar live primarily in the Irrawaddy River basin and speak the Burmese language, which is the sole official language of Myanmar at a national level. 
		  Bamar customs and identity are closely intertwined with the broader Burmese culture. 
		  The Bamar people are often imprecisely called "Burmese", though this term in contemporary usage can refer to any citizen of Myanmar, regardless of ethnicity.

		  The Mon are an ethnic group who inhabit Myanmar's Mon State, Bago Region, the Irrawaddy Delta, the southern Myanmar border with Thailand, and Thailand's Thon Buri District, Pakret District, Phra Pradaeng District and Lat Krabang District.
The Mon were one of the earliest peoples to reside in Southeast Asia, and they were responsible for the spread of Theravada Buddhism in Mainland Southeast Asia. The civilisations founded by the Mon people were some of the earliest civilisations in the early history of Thailand as well as in the early history of Myanmar.
They speak the Mon language, an Austroasiatic language, and share a common origin with the Nyah Kur people of Thailand; they are from the Mon mandala (polity) of Dvaravati. A number of languages in Mainland Southeast Asia are heavily influenced by the Mon language. The Mon were a major source of influence on the culture of Myanmar and the culture of Thailand. Historically, many cities in both Myanmar and Thailand today, including Yangon and Bangkok were founded either by the Mon people or Mon rulers.
<br>
Nowadays, the Mon are a major ethnic group in Myanmar and a minor ethnic group in Thailand. The Mons from Myanmar are called Burmese Mon or Myanmar Mon. The Mons from Thailand (Siamese of ethnic Mon) are referred as Thai-Raman or Thai Mon. The Mon dialects of Thailand and Myanmar are mutually understandable.

The Rakhine people (formerly Arakanese Mog) are an ethnic group in Myanmar (Burma) forming the majority along the coastal region of present-day Rakhine State (formerly officially called Arakan). They possibly constitute 5.53% or more of Myanmar's total population, but no accurate census figures exist. 
Rakhine people also live in the southeastern parts of Bangladesh, especially in Chittagong Division and Barisal Division. 
A group of Rakhine descendants, living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh at least since the 16th century, are known as the Marma people or Mog people.
Arakanese descendants spread as far north as Tripura state in India, where their presence dates back to the ascent of the Arakanese kingdom when Tripura was ruled by Arakanese kings. In northeast India, these Arakanese people are referred to as the Mog, while in Indian history, the Marma (the ethnic Arakanese descendants in Bangladesh) and other Arakanese people are referred to as the Magh people.

The Shan people or Tai Shan or Tai Yai are a Tai ethnic group of Southeast Asia. 
The Shan live primarily in the Shan State of Burma (Myanmar), but also inhabit parts of Mandalay Region, Kachin State, and Kayin State, and in adjacent regions of China (Dai people), Laos, Assam (Ahom people) and Thailand. Though no reliable census has been taken in Burma since 1935, the Shan are estimated to number 4â€“6 million, with CIA Factbook giving an estimate of five million spread throughout Myanmar.
'Shan' is a generic term for the people of all Tai ethnicity inside Myanmar (Burma). The capital of Shan State is Taunggyi, the fifth-largest city in Myanmar with about 390,000 people. Other major cities include Thibaw (Hsipaw), Lashio, Kengtung and Tachileik.
		</p><br>
		<p>
Shan State is a state of Myanmar. 
Shan State borders China (Yunnan) to the north, Laos (Louang Namtha and Bokeo Provinces) to the east, and Thailand (Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai and Mae Hong Son Provinces) to the south, and five administrative divisions of Burma in the west. 
Largest of the 14 administrative divisions by land area, Shan State covers 155,800 km2, almost a quarter of the total area of Burma. 
The state gets its name from Burmese name for the Tai people: "Shan people". 
The Shan constitute the majority among several ethnic groups that inhabit the area. 
Shan is largely rural, with only three cities of significant size: Lashio, Kengtung, and the capital, Taunggyi. 
Taunggyi is 150.7 km northeast of the nation's capital Naypyitaw.
